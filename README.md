## Configuration

First you need to create a file named `appsettings.json` in the root of the project:

```json
{
  "Discord": {
    "Token": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
  },
  "OpenRouter": {
    "ApiKey": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
  }
}
```
Run the bot:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Commands

| Command      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/start`     | Start hourly fact posting |
| `/stop`      | Stop posting |
| `/language`  | Select the language via buttons |
| `/nextfact`  | Get an instant fact |
